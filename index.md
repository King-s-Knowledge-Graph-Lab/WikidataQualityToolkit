    <div class="content">
      <p>RQV provides an automated pipeline that verifies whether Knowledge Graph triples are supported by their documented sources. It involves text extraction, triple verbalization, sentence selection, and claim verification using rule-based methods and machine learning models. The users can verify the reference quality of specific document or wikidata item by using this tool. Futhermore, this tool supports to verify a batch of documents and wikidata tiems automatically. </p>

    <p>Wikidata Game+ builds upon the Wikidata game by incorporating a novel recommendation system that includes user, time, and relation representation tasks based on matrix factorization, ELMo, and TransR embedding techniques. It supports providing recommendation items based on user history data and various types of machine learning techniques. </p>

    <p>There are numerous issues with Wikidata modeling and data quality, with inconsistent modeling of EntitySchemas being one of the most significant challenges nowadays. The EntitySchema generator addresses this by generating reference patterns of entity schemas for specific topics of entities based on Large Language Models (LLMs). By training on both good and bad examples, it can generate reference patterns and evaluate the quality of entity schemas. Additionally, it can modify inconsistent entity schemas based on the generated best patterns, and provide explanations and additional comments leveraging the capabilities of LLMs. </p>
